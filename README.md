# Formula Student OBD Gauge & Steering Display System

This project was developed as part of Formula Student Team Infinity Racers (UIT RGPV) for SUPRA SAE India held at Buddh International Circuit, where the team secured AIR 7.

The system was designed to provide real-time vehicle monitoring and driver feedback through a steering-mounted embedded display unit.

## Project Objective
To build a reliable, compact, and responsive OBD gauge system capable of processing vehicle data and displaying critical parameters to the driver during dynamic racing conditions.

## System Overview
The OBD gauge integrates multiple sensors and display modules to deliver real-time data visualization and driver alerts.

### Key Features:
- Real-time vehicle data monitoring
- OLED + 7-segment multi-display interface
- LED-based status indicators
- Sensor data processing
- Steering-mounted custom enclosure

## Tech Stack & Hardware
- Arduino Mega (Main Controller)
- MCP2515 (CAN ID Data processing)
- OLED Display Module
- 7-Segment Display
- Proximity Sensor
- LED Indicators
- SolidWorks CAD Modeling for enclosure

## Engineering Learnings
During final vehicle integration, a short circuit prevented deployment of the gauge in the main car. This experience strengthened understanding of:
- Circuit protection techniques
- Hardware debugging
- Reliable embedded system design
- Real-world system integration challenges
